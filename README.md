# yage - Yet Another Game Engine

This is my attempt on learning OpenGL, so I wouldn't recommend using this engine to create a game.

But feel free to use it if you want.


## TODOs

- [ ] Decide which file loading methode we are going to use (src/shader.cpp)


## Things I might use (in the future):

* [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
* [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
* [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
* ...


## Gists that contain useful OpenGL code (atleast for me)

* [Initialization of OpenGL buffers](https://gist.github.com/ffuszthaler/e2275ce3f233efe7653f5ce47292dbdc)
